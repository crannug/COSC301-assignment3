# Expense Tracker: System Test Cases

Run each test and fill in **Actual output**: write **Pass** if it matches the expected output, or describe what happened instead. **Author** is the person who wrote the test.

## Before each test

Do a **clean start**, so every test begins with no data:

1. Stop the server (`Ctrl+C`).
2. Delete the `data/` folder.
3. Run `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:3000`.

**Preconditions** in a test are extra steps on top of the clean start. Unless a test says otherwise, use today's date and the category **Basic need**.

## Glossary

### Test IDs

`ST-UC1-S1-03` means:

| Part | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `ST` | System test |
| `UC1` | Use case UC-1 (Manage expenses) in the SRS. `UC2` is Manage salary, `UC3` is View summary |
| `S1` | Subflow S1 (Add). `S2` View, `S3` Edit, `S4` Delete. `A2` would be alternative flow A2, and `MF` the main flow |
| `03` | Third test for that flow |

### Techniques

| Code | Technique | What it checks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REQ | Requirement-based | A flow from the SRS works as written |
| EC | Equivalence class | One input stands for a whole group that should behave the same (e.g. any valid category) |
| BV | Boundary value | Inputs **below**, **at** and **above** a limit. Each boundary has all three tests |
| DT | Diabolical testing | Inputs meant to break the app: special characters, code, extreme values |

**Notes:**

- Feel free to add additional tests.
- **Boundary values:** the boundary in our case is `0.01`. This is because the smallest money amount we accept is 0.01 not 0. So, the three tests are `0.00` (below), `0.01` (at) and `0.02` (above).
- **In a real project there would be many more tests.** We kept this list short for the assignment. For example, a full test plan would also cover what happens when the server is not running or the data file cannot be saved, when the same expense is deleted in two browser tabs, the list limit of 3 (below, at and above), descriptions at the 100-character limit, and unusual input such as `<script>` tags or very large amounts.
